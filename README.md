**Files Description**

app.py
Contains the Flask application code that serves "Hello, world!" at the root endpoint.

Dockerfile
Defines the Docker image for the Flask app based on the official Python 3.11 slim image.

docker-compose.yml
Defines the Docker Compose service for running the Flask app container, maps ports, mounts the current directory, and sets the environment.

requirements.txt
Lists Python dependencies required by the Flask app.
(Note: Your current requirements.txt has a typo: FLASH should be Flask)

**Prerequisites**

Docker installed (Get Docker
)

Docker Compose installed (Install Docker Compose
)

**Setup Instructions** 

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


**Fix requirements.txt**

Make sure your requirements.txt contains:

Flask


**Build and run with Docker Compose**

This will build the Docker image and run the Flask app inside a container:

docker-compose up --build


**Access the app**

Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:5000/


You should see:

Hello, world!

**Development Workflow**

The volumes entry in docker-compose.yml mounts your current directory (.) to /app inside the container, so any changes to your source files are immediately reflected inside the running container.

FLASK_ENV=development enables Flask's debug mode with hot reloading.

**Dockerfile Explanation**

Uses python:3.11-slim base image for a minimal Python environment.

Sets /app as working directory.

Copies requirements.txt and installs Python dependencies.

Copies the rest of the project files into the container.

Exposes port 5000.

Runs the Flask app with python app.py.

**Troubleshooting**

Port already in use: Make sure port 5000 is free or change the mapping in docker-compose.yml.

Dependencies not installing: Verify requirements.txt content and spelling (Flask is case-sensitive).

Changes not reflecting: Ensure volume mounting is working and you are saving your files.

**Extending the App**

Add more routes in app.py as needed.

Add tests and CI/CD integration.

Use a production WSGI server like gunicorn instead of the Flask built-in server for production deployments.
